# Employee Salary Prediction

This project is part of the **"AI and ML - June 2025" Internship** conducted by **Edunet Foundation** in collaboration with **IBM SkillsBuild**.

## 📌 Objective
To build a machine learning model that predicts employee salaries based on various input features such as education level, occupation, hours worked per week, etc.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Streamlit
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Project Structure
- `app.py` – Streamlit app for predictions
- `model/` – Contains trained ML model
- `data/` – Dataset used for training
- `notebooks/` – EDA and model development notebooks

## 🚀 How to Run
Place the CSV file (adult 3.csv) in the same directory as employee-salary-prediction.py.

Run the Streamlit app using the terminal or command prompt:


"streamlit run employee-salary-prediction.py"


The app will open in your browser. You can explore EDA, model evaluation, and make income predictions
